# propertygraph

Persisted property graphs in Haskell, primarily aimed towards for developing
quick prototypes of graph-based ideas.

## Features

- Extends the [algebraic graphs](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga) package to
  support edge and vertex labelled graphs (aka. property graphs)
- JSON persistence of both the graph and edit operations through acid-state.

## Example

See
[Example.hs](https://github.com/srid/propertygraph/blob/master/example/src/Example.hs)
for example usage.
